# Heritability and Genetic Correlations

The heritability and genetic correlations (co-heritability between traits) are population indices capturing what is the total signals of genetic variants given trait of interest. They are oftentimes used to reasoning the biological architecture of a given trait, albeit indirectly. They can be very useful if we are exploring novel ways to do phenotyping.

### Individual data based estimates
