# âš½ Our goal

Welcome to the 2023 hackathon event hosted by the Laureate Institute for Brain Research (LIBR). As we strive to push the boundaries of understanding the human brain, we recognize the power and potential of large-scale neuroscience data in steering our research forward. This hackathon is designed with the explicit purpose of empowering LIBR researchers to familiarize themselves with the nuances and intricacies of large-scale neuroscience data.

We are excited to ignite the spirit of teamwork and collaboration through this event, inviting participants to delve into domain-specific analysis utilizing two exceptionally rich resources - the UK Biobank and the ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development) datasets. Both of these present an unprecedented opportunity to gain insights into the intricate workings of the brain and human cognition.

In the broader sense, this hackathon is not just an event - it's an invitation to embrace a new approach, to jump aboard the team data science journey. We believe that by fostering a culture of collaborative data-driven research, we can unravel the complexities of the human brain more effectively. We look forward to seeing the innovative ideas and solutions that will emerge from this venture, inspiring us all to navigate the vast sea of neuroscience data together.
